                    HowdyHack is a competition where you and a team design and attempt to implement a project in twenty-four hours. 
                    At the most recent <a href="https://hh23.tamuhack.org/">HowdyHack</a>, the team I was on decided to implement a campus specific navigation app. A student would simply input 
                    their desired destination and the app would tell them the fastest route. While the task seems relatively straightforward, we introduced
                    further complexity by factoring in method of travel: a determined route could be walking, the campus buses, or a combination. My primary
                    responsibility was pulling information from the university transportation website about the daily bus routes and hours. I learned about 
                    and worked with requests to pull json files from the (somewhat deprecated) website. I then parsed the information in the json files, providing the needed 
                    information about each buses' routes and times. This information was used in tandem with Google Maps api to create a graph from which the 
                    shortest path could be extracted. Additionally, I worked on an elementary gui (using tkinter) that would allow a user to select a location that could 
                    then be passed into the shortest path algorithm. Overall, I am extremely happy with the work I did and the final result; however, there were 
                    some planned features that we were unable to complete within the time constraints, including a calendar feature that would plan your route 
                    for the entire day and weather considerations. You may view the project on <a href="https://github.com/andrewleachtx/JIT">GitHub</a>.

                        In my freshamn year, I attended my first hackathon, <a href="https://tamuhack.org/th/2023">TAMUHack</a> (which functions essentially the same as HowdyHack). My team's plan was to 
                        make a website that would help students to budget by breaking down their expenses, a quite ambitious goal as no one within the group knew 
                        even the basics of making a website (I was planning on being a mechanical engineer at the time). However we did not flounder, we immediately jumped 
                        into research. Deciding on a python backend, I began learning flask. Then, with limited time, I started on the frontend while learning the basics of html 
                        and CSS. The end result was not pretty nor was it functional. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the event and am proud of the effort we put into what amounted to an 
                        impossible task for our skills at the time. It was an ugly, dirty, yet enjoyable process, and the experience is part of the reason I now study computer science.

                        My upcoming/ongoing project involves an app called <a href="https://rockbot.com/music">RockBot</a>. I first encountered RockBot at the 
                        campus dining halls. How it works is you download the app, it connects you to your nearest RockBot location (the dining hall for me), 
                        and you can enter music into a queue, and that music will eventually be played at that location! With just that feature, the app is fun, but 
                        the level aspect is what got me hooked. Depending on how often you used the app, the higher your account level, and the higher your level the 
                        more priority your songs recieved in the queue. I immediately began grinding to the point that I am fairly certain I hold the highest RockBot 
                        level on campus. Eventually, I began wondering if I could automate this process: create a script that would automatically input songs into the 
                        queue and thereby automatically increase my level. I have several ideas as to the implementation. Firstly, I could have a script manually input 
                        "clicks" to open the app, load a song, then, every designated period, visually check if my song had played, loading another song if it had. I dislike this 
                        implementation because it has too many seams, so now I am researching ways I could interact with the app through api calls or some other less 
                        clunky manner. Some introductory code (and eventually the entire project) can be seen on <a href="https://github.com/GMar25/RockBotBot">here</a>.
