                        The languages I am most familiar with are C++ and Python. I was introduced to Python two years ago as my first programming language, and, 
                        slightly later, I began instruction in C++. I have since completed multiple courses and projects involving these languages. At the beginning 
                        of the year (2023) I continued my studies onto Scheme (a LISP dialect) and Java. I studied both for a semester, completing several projects 
                        and assignments ranging from small to quite extensive. I now consider myself competent in both languages. Currently, I am undertaking a 
                        class with a focus on web development; consequently, I am learning (or going to learn) many languages related to web development. Already, my 
                        studies of HTML and CSS have significantly progressed (as this website shows or will soon show).

                        Some of my notable technical skills that do strictly fall under the category of programming languages include numpy, JavaFx, and GitHub. 
                        I began using numpy almost in tandem with Python. Although, I haven't had any large projects that have extensively utilized numpy. I have 
                        been utilizing it occasionally for two years. I learned JavaFx concurrently with Java. I have made multiple basic GUI's using JavaFx and 
                        Scene Builder with Java as a backend. Finally, I have utilized in GitHub in all the hackathons I have attended and it is now commonly 
                        integrated into my classwork.

                Even as a kid, I remember loving problem solving. It's a process grounded in curiosity; at each stage, you ask question after question, 
                gathering the information you think you'll need. Then you have a trial run with that information which inevitabily leads to more questions. 
                The content of the question was never extremely important to me; I loved the whirling cycle of learning and applying. I hope one day I can 
                solve problems professionally by designing software. That's why my area of interest is software engineering. It's a field the tool I 
                focused on the creation of solutions, and a field were I'll be forced to ask question after question. The same process that I loved as a 
                child, now with programming as my problem-solving tool.
