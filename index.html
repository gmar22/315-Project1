                    Howdy! My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gage-mariano-3a9218233/">Gage Mariano</a>, and I am a current junior computer science major at Texas A&M University. I am originally from Mansfield 
                    (a Dallas suburb), Texas where I lived for almost my entire life before coming to A&M. Ironically, when I went into college, I did so with 
                    the intent of being a mechanical engineering major. Then, in my first semester, I took what was essentially a introductory python course. I 
                    enjoyed the course content, but I still planned to declare as a mechanical engineering student. As the next semester progressed, I found myself 
                    thinking about how certain problems would be solved in python and even creating some programs for classes that in no way required or were 
                    related to coding. By the next semester, I was officially a computer science major. Some of the topics I have really enjoyed learning about 
                    include data structures and computer architecture. Data structures are interesting to me because they are a bridge between concept and 
                    implementation. Being familiar with a variety of data structures allows me to quickly translate my thoughts to code (or realize that my 
                    ideas are not easily implementable). Computer architecture (particularly logic gates) are interesting to me because of how tiny, simple pieces 
                    accumulate to form extensive, complex systems. The computer architecture class I took here at A&M is my favorite class I have ever taken 
                    (so far) because of this cumulative nature. At the end of the course, I felt like I could explain every aspect of what we had learned down 
                    to a very fundamental level along with how each concept interconnected; I really loved the completeness of the subject. In general, I am 
                    an diligent, easy-going, and curious student who enjoys what he is studying and the people around it. I work well and enjoying working with a 
                    all sorts of people (which is probably why my <a href="technical.html">favorite project</a>  was a group project), and I look forward to the many 
                    experiences I know are now just up the road.

                Outside of computer science, I enjoy reading, guitar, and ping pong. I used to be a voracious reader, reading one or two books a week; sadly, 
                I have slowed down now, but it is still something I fall back on and enjoy. I began learning guitar a little less than two years ago, and, 
                despite still being no good, I love hammering out a few chords and stumbling over a couple riffs almost everyday. Finally, I started playing 
                ping pong probably three years ago now, and its a great break from all the sitting I do as a computer science student.
