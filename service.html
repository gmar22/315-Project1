        <!-- Big Event 2023 -->
        <div class="BE2023">
            <p>
                BigEvent is a big volunteering event here at A&M. You and a group of friends are assigned a house that needs help with some labor intensive tasks. 
                At the most recent <a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</a>, my friends and I were assigned a house not far from campus that needed a fence to be disassembled, moved, and 
                set back up (as well as a little painting). It was fairly difficult work in hot weather, but the strain is eased by talking to your friends and 
                the owner of a house. We learned that she was a former A&M student who had attended the vet school, bonded over the sorry state of the some of the 
                ancient buildings on campus, and discovered that the <em>numerous</em> dogs around the house were holdovers from her vet practice (as well as the reason 
                she needed a fence). This was my second Big Event and by far my favorite; the atmosphere was immensely fun and it felt good to be physically helping someone. 
                The fence turned out decent too.

                The first Big Event I went to was with a similar group at a house a little further removed from campus but that needed a lot more work. We worked on the yard: 
                trimming bushes, gathering leaves and other debris, and overturning garden beds. I was assigned to the garden beds where I shoveled until all the dirt in the 
                bed was loose and ready to be filled with plants. To close out the event, I joined my teammates raking. Unfortunately, since there was so much 
                to do we didn't really get the cahnce to talk to the owners of the house. I still enjoyed the event (obviously enough to do it the next year) and it 
                was wonderful to see the transformation the lawn went through thanks to our efforts.

                    Beyond Big Event, I also am a current member of <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/academics/eh/about/index.html">Engineering Honors</a> at Texas A&M, and regularly participate in hackathons (which you can read more 
                    about in my <a href= "./technical.html">Technical Section</a>).

                    One event I plan to participate in is the <a href="https://physicsfestival.tamu.edu/">Physics Festival</a>. I've always really enjoyed physics (enough 
                    to even minor in it), and the goal of this event is to spread the love of physics. It's aimed primarily at elementary kids to come and see 
                    different demonstrations and learn a few related physics concepts. The festival is all about making physics visually cool and exciting. I really look 
                    forward to participating next semester.
